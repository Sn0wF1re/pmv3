        The Morans Origin Story is a story about Morans,
        who dwelt with their creator Laibon in a dimension
        known as the Maasphere. But having been deceived
        by Giza, are banished into planet Wakawaka,
        where they are plagued by pain and bondage
        under the rule of merchants who are underlings
        of Giza, a fallen warrior of Laibon.
        A mysterious power is believed to get the morans
        back to the maasphere, but for centuries, has eluded them.
        Meanwhile Laibon, in hope, instigates the power of Urim
        that raises 12 moran superheroes, in 12 nations who embark
        on a journey to BECOME, later unifying morans with Laibon
        back to their origins in the Maasphere.
